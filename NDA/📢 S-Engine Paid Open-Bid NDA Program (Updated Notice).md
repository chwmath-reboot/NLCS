# 💰 **NDA Bid Structure**

## **Eligible Bidders**

NDA pricing is determined using the **top 5 highest bids** received.

------

## **Condition A — Simultaneous NDA Access**

If the gap between the **highest bid** and the **5th highest bid**
 is **within 15%**,
 → NDA access will be granted **simultaneously** to all companies
 that agree to match the highest bid.

------

## **Condition B — Exclusive NDA Access**

If the **highest bid is 3× or more** than the **second-highest bid**,
 → The top bidder receives a **2-week exclusive NDA viewing window**.
 No other company may access the documents during that period.

# 🛡️ **Why a Paid NDA Is Required**

1. **The S-Engine documents are written primarily in Korean and are inherently vulnerable to unauthorized copying.**
    A paid NDA acts as a minimum security barrier.
2. **Simply reading the documents allows analysis of NLCS principles.**
    S-Engine combines narrative logic with mathematical constraints, enabling deep insight into LLM behavior optimization.
3. **The S-Engine Usage Guide contains private research accumulated over many years.**
    These insights are as valuable as the engine itself.
