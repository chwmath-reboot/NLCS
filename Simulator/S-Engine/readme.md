**S-Engine is a narrative simulator implemented using 7 text files.**

This repository releases the process of implementing this narrative simulator in HTML format using Claude.

Each version demonstrates the evolution into a fully functional simulator driven solely by narrative logic.

The public release covers versions up to v8.4, while development has currently reached v10.0.**

**You are free to adopt and use the balance system utilized in this engine.**

I believe it will serve as a physics engine that is significantly lighter and more powerful than existing log-based systems.

However, you must explicitly credit "ShadowK" as the original source.

**Please be aware that I am planning to release a game utilizing this engine.**
